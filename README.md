## Gherkin Mode

An emacs major mode for editing
[gherkin](https://github.com/alandipert/gherkin) files.

Install it:

```emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gherkin-mode")
(require 'gherkin-mode)
```

gherkin-mode is extremely basic, being little more than a derivative of lisp mode with gherkin keyword highlighting.
Want me to do more with it? Drop an [issue](https://github.com/candera/gherkin-mode/issues) and maybe I will! Or maybe
not! You have no way of knowing! It'll be fun, like playing the lottery!
